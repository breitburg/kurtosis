### Internationalization

The application supports multiple languages with **Dutch as the default**. Currently supported languages:

- ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± **Nederlands** (Dutch) - Default
- ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ **English**
- ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· **FranÃ§ais** (French)
- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª **Deutsch** (German)

#### Adding a New Language

The application uses **automatic language detection** from available translation files. To add support for a new language:

1. **Create a translation file** in `src/i18n/locales/[lang-code].json`
   ```bash
   # Example: adding Spanish
   cp src/i18n/locales/en.json src/i18n/locales/es.json
   ```

2. **Translate all text strings** in the new JSON file
   - Keep the same JSON structure
   - Translate only the values, not the keys
   - Use `{{variable}}` syntax for interpolated values
   - **Important**: Add a `languageDisplayName` key with the language's native name:
   ```json
   {
     "languageDisplayName": "EspaÃ±ol",
     "welcome": "Bienvenido",
     ...
   }
   ```

3. **Add the language import** to `src/i18n/i18n.js`:
   ```javascript
   import es from './locales/es.json';
   
   const resources = {
     // ... existing languages
     es: {
       translation: es
     }
   };
   ```

That's it! The `LanguageSwitcher` component automatically detects available languages from the i18n resources and displays them using their native names from the `languageDisplayName` key. Date formatting uses the raw language code (e.g., 'es') for native localization.

The language preference is automatically saved to localStorage and will persist across browser sessions.
