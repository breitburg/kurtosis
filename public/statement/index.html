                <h3>TL;DR</h3>

                <p>In early 2024, we launched <a href="https://kurtosis.breitburg.com">Kurtosis</a>, a faster
                    alternative to KU Leuven's KURT library booking system. It became <a
                        href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KULeuven/comments/1dbwff1/weve_built_an_alternative_web_app_for_kurt/">one
                        of the most popular posts on r/KULeuven</a> and continues to serve hundreds of students,
                    demonstrating the clear need for an improved KURT system.</p>
                <p>Between June and October 2024, we developed a new mobile app for KURT featuring 4x faster
                    performance, 3D maps of study spaces, Face ID authentication for booking and check-in, and
                    smart seat-finding capabilities that work even when the library is full.</p>
                <p>The app was specifically engineered to integrate with existing KURT infrastructure, requiring no
                    maintenance from the university while consuming fewer server resources than the current KURT
                    system.</p>
                <p>Following an initial demo to the KURT team in September, dozens of emails, and a series of
                    presentations, we were invited to present the app and the future plan to
                    Campusbibliotheekraad Humane Wetenschappen in October 2024. Following this, we received an
                    unexpected rejection with no actionable feedback.</p>
                <p>We're sharing this information to provide students with transparency regarding the app's
                    non-launch and to spark a broader discussion about the evaluation process for student
                    initiatives.</p>
                <p>The current Kurtosis web app will stop working soon when KURTv2 is disabled. If you believe this
                    app would benefit the student community, here's <a href="#contact">how you can help</a>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="text-center text-gray-400">
                <p>Read the full statement below to see all the demos, screenshots, and presentations. We have a lot to
                    show you.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Hello</h2>
            <p>As students of KU Leuven who have experienced the pain of booking seats with KURT and saw other people
                struggling with it, we wanted to solve this problem and share our solution with
                other students.
            </p>

            <p>
                In early summer 2024 we publicly launched Kurtosis — a simple web page that allowed you
                to see the availability of the all seats in any library with a single click of a button.
            </p>

            <img src="https://kurtosis.breitburg.com/statement/assets/kurtosis.png" alt="Sample image of Kurtosis">

            <p>The response was overwhelming. <a
                    href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KULeuven/comments/1dbwff1/weve_built_an_alternative_web_app_for_kurt/">Post
                    about Kurtosis</a>
                on Reddit became one of the top-10 upvoted posts of all time on <a
                    href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KULeuven/top/">
                    r/kuleuven</a>. It was used by hundreds of students during summer blok, and people keep using it at
                the time of writing this post.</p>

            <p>We realized that we were not alone in our frustration with the official
                KURT interface, and we put out a survey on the Kurtosis page, essentially trying to figure out "Why are
                you here and not on the official KURT web app?" and also started researching by talking to people in
                person. The feedback was clear: the official web app was slow, clunky, and felt like filling out a tax
                return rather than finding a place to study.
            </p>

            <h2>Meet The App</h2>

            <p>Driven by the support from students, this motivated us to build a full
                mobile app for KURT, that will be faster, more efficient, and built around the feedback from students.
            </p>

            <p>We assembled a team of
                three people who previously contributed to Kurtosis and
                started by researching how students interact with library spaces and designing an interface around
                it. Over five months since June 2024, our team developed a mobile app for iOS and Android from scratch.
            </p>

            <p>
                The goal was not just to build a tool that allows "students to book seats from a list," but instead, it
                must be driven by a deep understanding of who uses it. Maybe they're tired from yesterday's party or
                stressed about tomorrow's exams — in every design decision, we must consider what we want the users to
                feel, how we can help them during stressful times, and not overwhelm them with unnecessary information.
            </p>

            <p>After all, booking seats in libraries is a part of student life, not just a
                service. Internally, we defined "efficiency and empathy" as our guiding principles.
            </p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Isometric maps of the libraries.</b> Pick yourself a seat visually, see where exactly your
                    bookings are on the map, not just
                    the seat numbers. <i>Inspired by The Sims.</i></li>
                </li>
                <li><b>On average, the app is 4 times faster than the KURT web app.</b> This includes
                    search, booking, and checking in.</li>
                <li><b>Smart search called 'Auto'.</b> It works instantly, prioritizes your favorites, and even can
                    automatically find available seat sequences when the library is full.</li>
                <li><b>Booking and checking in with Face ID or other built-in biometric system.</b> The app uses the
                    same phone hardware security features as banking apps, making it more secure than the browser.
                    No KU Leuven Authenticator is required, without compromising security.</li>
                <li><b>Reduced load on the KURT servers.</b> The app relies on the existing KURT infrastructure
                    and uses it more efficiently than the official web app, dramatically reducing server load
                    and requiring no ongoing support from the KURT team.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Find your seat on the map, not by decoding a seat number</h3>

            <p>Instead of going through endless lists of seats, we created an isometric map view (just like in The
                Sims), where you can actually see the library layout, the trees, the monitors, and most importantly –
                where you'll be studying. We wanted students to feel like they're choosing a real space, not just
                clicking a database entry.</p>

            <img src="https://kurtosis.breitburg.com/statement/assets/map-hd.png"
                alt="High definition map of the library">

            <p><i>Note: During development, we used a simplified version of the map to enable faster testing and
                    iteration,
                    rather than the final map design shown in the image above. In the interest of transparency, we chose
                    to include
                    actual screen recordings of the app, which show this simplified "development" version of the
                    map.</i></p>

            <h3>Find seats instantly, even when library is full</h3>

            <p>One of the most impressive features we've developed is called “Auto”. It's an intelligent alternative to
                random search, enabling you to find study seats even when the library is full and there are no seats in
                KURT.
            </p>

            <p>
                Simply select the time frame you're interested in, and the app will try to find the best seat for you,
                prioritizing your favourites.
                If there are no seats that are available for the entire duration,
                the app will create a sequence of available seats, optimizing for the least amount of seat switching, so
                you can study more without distractions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Booking a seat or a sequence of seats requires a single tap. No need to play around with filters,
                searches, and sitting with your notepad, calendar, and map trying to string everything together.
            </p>

            <h3>No more empty, but booked seats</h3>

            <p>We know that many people take breaks during their study sessions — be it for lunch, ping pong,
                or just a small walk. Most of the time, they keep the seat booked, and we get it — creating multiple
                reservations is kind of a hassle.</p>

            <p>However, this leads to seats that appear booked in KURT, but are empty in reality, and that is
                frustrating
                for everyone — both people who need a seat and people who took a break because they can't make the seat
                available.</p>

            <p>
                Our app doesn't limit you to select a single time frame for your study session. You can add breaks
                between your study sessions, and the app will automatically figure out which bookings to make. And
                again, it's just a single tap.
            </p>

            <h2>Collaboration With KURT</h2>

            <p>In September 2024, we had a meeting with the KURT team where we presented our work. They were
                enthusiastic about the project and asked us to prepare a shorter pitch for higher management. This too
                was well-received, and we eventually got invited to give a presentation at the Campus Bibliotheek Raad
                Humane
                Wetenschappen meeting in October.</p>

            <p>On October 21st, we attended the meeting and presented our app, as well as explained our plan, ensuring
                sustainability and addressing any concerns regarding support. When we finished the presentation with the
                Q&A, no major concerns were raised about the app or the plan at all, which made us think that our
                presentation went very well.</p>

            <p>However, a few days later we received a rejection. It came in a brief email that expressed
                "significant concerns" citing four points:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Risks regarding security and privacy are "particularly high"</li>
                <li>Concerns about the lack of audit and monitoring capabilities</li>
                <li>Collaboration would require significant ongoing time investment</li>
                <li>Added value of the app "may be limited" due to the map being in the roadmap of KURTv3, described it
                    as
                    "the major shortcoming of KURT today"</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Their email ended with "we have decided not moving forward with this collaboration", and did not contain
                any actionable feedback. After 5 months of working on the app, it did come as a bit of a shock to the
                team, especially after all of the work we did to eliminate such concerns:
            </p>
            <h4>Security and Audit</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Our app implements stronger security measures than the browser-based solutions. We use the same
                    hardware security features used by banking apps.
                </li>
                <li>All data processing occurs locally on the user's device. The only service that processes any
                    personal data is KURT itself.</li>
                <li>We have been open to any possible security and privacy audits by the university or any third-party
                    experts to ensure the app meets all necessary standards.</li>
                <li>Additionally, at the time of the rejection, we have already proactively reported security
                    vulnerabilities in the current KURT system.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Time Investment</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The app was specifically designed to rely on existing infrastructure, it was a conscious decision to
                    minimize the ongoing support required from the KURT team.</li>
                <li>During development, we implemented authentication through an alternate method made available by the
                    KURT system, which didn't use KU Leuven Authenticator. The only thing we asked from the KURT team
                    was to allow us to use the official authentication system, so that we could make our app even more
                    secure. Once granted, our app would operate independently without requiring ongoing support from the
                    KURT team.</li>
                <li>Our team has also proposed a plan for a student organization to take over the app's maintenance and
                    development, ensuring that the workload will be distributed among students and not fall on the KURT
                    team.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Added Value</h4>

            <p>While the KURT team has mentioned to us that some of the features we have implemented are planned for
                KURTv3, such as floor plans, we believe that, even at the current stage, our app has a lot more to
                offer, namely:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>On average, the app is 4 times faster than the KURT web app across all scenarios. Users can launch
                    the app, book a seat, and view it on the study space map in just 15 seconds.</li>
                <li>Reduces server load dramatically, which was acknowledged by the KURT team. By our estimates
                    requiring up to 350% less compute <a href="#footnotes"><sup>1</sup></a> than the official KURT web
                    app.</li>
                <li>Enables authentication with Face ID or other built-in biometric systems instead of KU Leuven
                    Authenticator, without compromising security.</li>
                <li>Allows to check-in to the booked seat without the need to reauthenticate every time, again, without
                    compromising security.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Additionally, we had planned several app-specific features that are not possible in a web app:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Secure and privacy-preserving detection of users leaving study spaces, with prompts to check out
                    with a single tap, helping to further eliminate the issue of booked but empty seats in libraries.
                </li>
                <li>Live Activities on iOS and widgets on Android, allowing students to see how much time they have left
                    in their booking and receive notifications when their booking is about to expire.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Follow-up</h3>

            <p>
                On the same day, we sent a response to the council, asking for clarification on the rejection and
                details on how Quivr approaches data access. In the response, the council members:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Noted to "appreciate proactive approach" to reporting vulnerabilities in the KURT system.</li>
                <li>Recognized the efforts we have put into the app security, but mentioned that "trust is paramount,
                    and we cannot trust any code that uses student data deployed into production without full assurance
                    of its integrity and purpose."</li>
                <li>Justified the approval of Quivr by stating that it "operates on a read-only basis regarding KU
                    Leuven-stored student data" and handles "official KU Leuven class schedules, which are public
                    information," compared to "the broader access your app might require".
                </li>
                <li>Ended the email by stating the decision stems from a trust issue, "not with you personally but with
                    the potential risks involved" and resource limitations.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                We understand that the protection of student data is important, that's why our app was built from the
                ground up to operate without processing or storing any personal data — eliminating the need for trust
                entirely.

            <p>
                While the council's claim that KU Leuven is not sharing personal data with Quivr is <i>technically</i>
                true, Quivr still collects and processes student data, and even makes it available publicly <a
                    href="#footnotes"><sup>2</sup></a>. Our app doesn't process or store personal data at all.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since the university's decision to reject the app was based on a lack of trust and not on
                technical or security concerns, we have no way to address this issue. We have proposed solutions for
                every concern raised, but the university has not provided any actionable feedback or a path to approval.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Position</h2>

            <p>While we disagree with the reasons behind this decision, we are ready to implement any changes and have
                proposed solutions for all highlighted problems. As of now, we do not see a reliable path to our app's
                approval, so we are disappointed to say that it is highly unlikely that our app ever gets released.</p>

            <p>Our team has proposed solutions addressing all concerns, ranging from technical integration
                to long-term maintenance. Beyond offering to implement necessary modifications in collaboration with
                university technical teams, we developed a plan for a student organization to ensure the app's
                sustainability. This project started because we believed in KU Leuven's commitment of supporting
                student initiatives and we hoped to contribute to the university community.</p>
            <p>
                We're sharing this story because we believe in transparency, and
                because we hope it might spark a broader discussion about how student initiatives are evaluated. The
                code we wrote could have made hundreds of students' lives easier. Instead, it will remain unused.

            <p>We remain committed to finding ways to help fellow students and hope that future initiatives will find
                more support in their efforts to improve university systems.</p>

            <h2>What's Next</h2>
            <p>The KURT development team stated that the KURTv2 will be disabled soon, which means that Kurtosis will
                also stop working as it depends on the KURTv2 infrastructure, and we can't do anything about it.</p>
            <p>We know many of you have shared our frustration with the official KURT web application — the performance,
                the interface, and overall user experience. That's why so many students have embraced the
                Kurtosis app as a better alternative. The positive feedback and growing waitlist make it clear there is
                strong demand for a better solution.</p>

            <h3 id="contact">What You Can Do</h3>

            <p>Despite demonstrating that our app is significantly faster and more efficient
                than the current KURT system, the university has prohibited us from launching it. This decision feels
                like a major missed opportunity, both for students and for the university itself.</p>

            <p>If you believe this app would benefit the student community, you can help us by:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Filling out the interest form for the KURT app. This will help us show the university that there
                        is a demand for the app and that it would be useful.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Reaching out to KURT team or any other KU Leuven staff members you feel may be able to reconsider
                        this rejection:</p>

            <p>
                We ask you to make your voice heard and share any problems that you see with the current KURT system
                with the university. We hope that by helping the university understand how important a good seat
                reservation
                system is to a less stressful student life, we can compel them to reconsider their decision.
            </p>

            <p>Thank you for your support — it means everything to us.</p>

                <h4>Footnotes</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Since we don't have access to the KURT server logs, we don't have technical capacity to
                            measure the exact performance improvement. Therefore, we made a good-faith effort to
                            estimate
                            the performance improvement based on the number of requests made to the server and
                            approximated
                            complexity of the requests.</p>

                        <p>Example of the compute required for booking a seat with a one-hour break:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Data lookup call = 1 compute unit</li>
                            <li>Data write call = 1 compute unit</li>
                            <li>Seat search call = 4 compute units (due to the complexity of the query running on the
                                database server)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>For KURTv3: 1 (library data lookup) + 4 (search for booking before lunch) + 1 (book seat) + 4
                            (search for booking after lunch) + 1 (book seat) = 11 compute units</p>

                        <p>For the app: 1 (download availability data) + 2 (book two seats) = 3 compute units</p>

                        <p>The same calculation was done for other use cases, such as booking or searching for a seat,
                            and the results for some use cases were up to 3,5x performance improvement. While we
                            understand that this is a rough estimate, when we presented this to the KURT team, they
                            acknowledged that the app is a lot more efficient than the current system.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Quivr maintains a public directory of user profiles, including full names of enrolled
                            students, accessible to anyone with an account, and you don't have to be a student to create
                            a Quivr account. While this student data is not directly shared by KU
                            Leuven, it is collected and processed by Quivr on third-party servers, with no restrictions
                            on who can access this information.</p>

                        <p><i>Note: To be clear — we do not have any problems with Quivr, it't a good app and solves a
                                lot of students' problems. We think it's great when students make tools to make their
                                life easier, and that's why we made the KURT app.</i></p>
